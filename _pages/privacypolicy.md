## Pepper Weather does not share or sell any of your data
The only data the app stores can include any favorite locations, units of measure for weather, and others. These points of data are anonymous and saved locally so that no one other than you has access to this data.

For Pepper Weather to be most effective it may ask you for permission to have access to your current location. You may opt to grant Pepper Weather that access to receive localized weather forecasts but this can be turned off at any point in your devices' settings. It is not required for you to allow location access but it is highly recommended to get the best performance out of Pepper Weather. Pepper Weather may collect anonymized reports for crash analytics using Apple Analytics. Any anonymous information is only collected to help improve the app and is never shared, sold, or rented to any third party.
